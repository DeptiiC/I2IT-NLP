Specifically, vectors of numbers.

It is a popular and simple method  of feature extraction from text data. \n","\n","A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:\n","\n","1.   A vocabulary of known words.\n","2.   A measure of the presence of known words.\n","\n","It is called a “bag” of words, because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded.

Term frequency isn’t the best representation of the text because common words such as \"the\", \"a\", \"to\" are almost always the terms with highest frequency in the text.
